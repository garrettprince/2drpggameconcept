## General Information
- Simple 2D game demonstrating HTML Canvas with user inputs and GSAP animations
- I wanted to follow a tutorial (this one is based on Chris Courses' Pokemon Javascript Game with HTML Canvas) that would scale something relatively difficult using HTML Canvas and Javascript


## Technologies Used
- Javascript
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- GSAP v.3.10.1 
- HowlerJS v.2.2.3


## Features
- Navigate 2D environment using WASD, complete with barriers and elevation
- Engage in battles by walking in the dark patched of grass
- Re-enter the map after completion of battle, win or lose


## Screenshots

## Usage
Navigate using WASD and click for button interaction


## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_. 
- Basic structure of game is complete, but I will be adding a start screen with explanation of controls, original battle music, and small bug fixes


## Room for Improvement
Room for improvement:
- Could make the initial startup a bit more informative
- Better barrier sizes for easier navigation

To do:
- Implement startup screen when site loads that explains movement buttons and click interactions
- Different battle background music
- Tidy up code for readability
